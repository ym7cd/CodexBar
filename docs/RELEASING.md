# Release process (CodexBar)

SwiftPM-only; package/sign/notarize manually (no Xcode project). Sparkle feed is served from GitHub Releases. Checklist below merges Trimmy’s release flow with CodexBar specifics.

**Must read first:** open the master macOS release guide at `~/Projects/agent-scripts/docs/RELEASING-MAC.md` alongside this file and reconcile any differences in favor of CodexBar specifics before starting a release.

## Expectations
- When someone says “release CodexBar”, do the entire end-to-end flow: bump versions/CHANGELOG, build, sign and notarize, upload the zip to the GitHub release, generate/update the appcast with the new signature, publish the tag/release, and verify the enclosure URL responds with 200/OK and installs via Sparkle (no 404s or stale feeds).

### Release automation notes (Scripts/release.sh)
- Always forces a fresh build/notarization (no cached artifacts) before publishing.
- Fails fast if: git tree is dirty, the top changelog section is still “Unreleased” or mismatched, the target version already exists in the appcast, or the build number is not greater than the latest appcast entry.
- Sparkle key probe runs up front; appcast entry + signature verified automatically after generation.
- Release notes are extracted directly from the current changelog section and passed to the GitHub release (no manual notes flag needed).
- Requires tools/env on PATH: `swiftformat`, `swiftlint`, `swift`, `sign_update`, `gh`, `python3`, `zip`, `curl`, plus `APP_STORE_CONNECT_*` and `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`.

## Prereqs
- Xcode 26+ installed at `/Applications/Xcode.app` (for ictool/iconutil and SDKs).
- Developer ID Application cert installed: `Developer ID Application: Peter Steinberger (Y5PE65HELJ)`.
- ASC API creds in env: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`.
- Sparkle keys: public key already in Info.plist; private key path set via `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` when generating appcast.
- Ensure shell has release env vars loaded (usually `source ~/.profile`) before running `Scripts/release.sh`.

## Icon (glass .icon → .icns)
```
./Scripts/build_icon.sh Icon.icon CodexBar
```
Uses Xcode’s `ictool` + transparent padding + iconset → Icon.icns.

## Build, sign, notarize (arm64)
```
./Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh
```
What it does:
- `swift build -c release --arch arm64`
- Packages `CodexBar.app` with Info.plist and Icon.icns
- Embeds Sparkle.framework, Updater, Autoupdate, XPCs
- Codesigns **everything** with runtime + timestamp (deep) and adds rpath
- Zips to `CodexBar-<version>.zip`
- Submits to notarytool, waits, staples, validates

Gotchas fixed:
- Sparkle needs signing for framework, Autoupdate, Updater, XPCs (Downloader/Installer) or notarization fails.
- Use `--timestamp` and `--deep` when signing the app to avoid invalid signature errors.
- Avoid `unzip` — it can add AppleDouble `._*` files that break the sealed signature and trigger “app is damaged”. Use Finder or `ditto -x -k CodexBar-<ver>.zip /Applications`. If Gatekeeper complains, delete the app bundle, re-extract with `ditto`, then `spctl -a -t exec` to verify.
- Manual sanity check before uploading: `find CodexBar.app -name '._*'` should return nothing; then `spctl --assess --type execute --verbose CodexBar.app` and `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose CodexBar.app` should both pass on the packaged bundle.

## Appcast (Sparkle)
After notarization:
```
SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ed25519-priv.key \
./Scripts/make_appcast.sh CodexBar-0.1.0.zip \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steipete/CodexBar/main/appcast.xml
```
Uploads not handled automatically—commit/publish appcast + zip to the feed location (GitHub Releases/raw URL).

## Tag & release
```
git tag v<version>
./Scripts/make_appcast.sh ...
# upload zip + appcast to Releases
# then create GitHub release (gh release create v<version> ...)
```

## Homebrew (Cask)
CodexBar ships a Homebrew **Cask** in `../homebrew-tap`. When installed via Homebrew, CodexBar disables Sparkle and the app
must be updated via `brew`.

After publishing the GitHub release, update the tap cask (see `docs/releasing-homebrew.md`).

## Checklist (quick)
- [ ] Read both this file and `~/Projects/agent-scripts/docs/RELEASING-MAC.md`; resolve any conflicts toward CodexBar’s specifics.
- [ ] Update versions (scripts/Info.plist, CHANGELOG, About text) — changelog top section must be finalized; release script pulls notes from it automatically.
- [ ] `swiftformat`, `swiftlint`, `swift test` (zero warnings/errors)
- [ ] `./Scripts/build_icon.sh` if icon changed
- [ ] `./Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh`
- [ ] Generate Sparkle appcast with private key
  - Sparkle ed25519 private key path: `/Users/steipete/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Backup/Sparkle/sparkle-private-key-KEEP-SECURE.txt` (primary) and `/Users/steipete/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Backup/Sparkle-VibeTunnel/sparkle-private-key-KEEP-SECURE.txt` (older backup)
  - Upload the dSYM archive alongside the app zip on the GitHub release; the release script now automates this and will fail if it’s missing.
  - After publishing the release, run `Scripts/check-release-assets.sh <tag>` to confirm both the app zip and dSYM zip are present on GitHub.
  - Sign the zip with `sign_update --ed-key-file "$SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE" CodexBar-<ver>.zip`; use that exact signature and length in the appcast (no manual base64 copy/paste).
  - After generating the appcast, download the enclosure URL and re-run `sign_update --ed-key-file "$SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE" <downloaded.zip>`; abort if signature or length differs from the appcast.
- [ ] Upload zip + appcast to feed; publish tag + GitHub release so Sparkle URL is live (avoid 404)
- [ ] Homebrew tap: update `../homebrew-tap/Casks/codexbar.rb` (url + sha256), then verify:
  - `brew uninstall --cask codexbar || true`
  - `brew untap steipete/tap || true; brew tap steipete/tap`
  - `brew install --cask steipete/tap/codexbar && open -a CodexBar`
- [ ] Version continuity: confirm the new version is the immediate next patch/minor (no gaps) and CHANGELOG has no skipped numbers (e.g., after 0.2.0 use 0.2.1, not 0.2.2)
- [ ] Changelog sanity: single top-level title, no duplicate version sections, versions strictly descending with no repeats
- [ ] Release pages: title format `CodexBar <version>`, notes as Markdown list (no stray blank lines)
- [ ] Changelog/release notes are user-facing: avoid internal-only bullets (build numbers, script bumps) and keep entries concise
- [ ] Download uploaded `CodexBar-<ver>.zip`, unzip via `ditto`, run, and verify signature (`spctl -a -t exec -vv CodexBar.app` + `stapler validate`)
- [ ] Confirm `appcast.xml` points to the new zip/version and renders correct release notes
- [ ] Verify on GitHub Releases: assets present (zip, appcast), release notes match changelog, version/tag correct
- [ ] Open the appcast URL in browser to confirm the new entry is visible and enclosure URL is reachable
- [ ] Manually visit the enclosure URL (curl -I) to ensure 200/OK (no 404) after publishing assets/release
- [ ] Ensure `sparkle:edSignature` is present for the enclosure in appcast (generate with `sign_update`/ed25519 key)
- [ ] When creating the GitHub release, paste the CHANGELOG entry as Markdown list (one `-` per line, blank line between sections); visually confirm bullets render correctly after publishing
- [ ] Keep a previous signed build in `/Applications/CodexBar.app` to test Sparkle delta/full update to the new release
- [ ] Manual Gatekeeper sanity: after packaging, `find CodexBar.app -name '._*'` is empty, `spctl --assess --type execute --verbose CodexBar.app` and `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose CodexBar.app` succeed
- [ ] For Sparkle verification: if replacing `/Applications/CodexBar.app`, quit first, replace, relaunch, and test update
- **Definition of “done” for a release:** all of the above are complete, the appcast/enclosure link resolves, Homebrew cask
  installs, and a previous public build can update to the new one via Sparkle. Anything short of that is not a finished release.

## Troubleshooting
- **White plate icon**: regenerate icns via `build_icon.sh` (ictool) to ensure transparent padding.
- **Notarization invalid**: verify deep+timestamp signing, especially Sparkle’s Autoupdate/Updater and XPCs; rerun package + sign-and-notarize.
- **App won’t launch**: ensure Sparkle.framework is embedded under `Contents/Frameworks` and rpath added; codesign deep.
- **App “damaged” dialog after unzip**: re-extract with `ditto -x -k`, removing any `._*` files, then re-verify with `spctl`.
- **Update download fails (404)**: ensure the release asset referenced in appcast exists and is published in the corresponding GitHub release; verify with `curl -I <enclosure-url>`.
